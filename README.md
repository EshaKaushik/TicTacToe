# TicTacToe
This project is about a famous frontend game named 'TIC TAC TOE' with creativity in its display.

Rules of the Game:
1. The game is played on a grid that is 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. Among the two players, one gets to mark X and the other player marks O. Players take turns alternately one after another putting their marks in the tic tac toe board.
3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. The game continues till either of the player wins or when all 9 squares are full and no winning pattern is achieved on the board. 
In such a case (If no player is able to get a winning pattern), the game ends in a tie.
